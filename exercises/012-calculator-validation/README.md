## Calculator - Input Validation

Welcome to the final exercise in the Simple Calculator series! You've built a calculator that handles basic and advanced math, accepts string inputs, and formats output beautifully. But there's one critical piece missing: **error handling**.

What happens when someone enters "hello" instead of a number? Or tries to divide by zero? Right now, your calculator would produce confusing results like `NaN` or `Infinity`. Professional applications validate inputs and show helpful error messages instead.

**Building on previous exercises**: This exercise completes your calculator from exercises 008-011 by adding robust input validation and error handling.

## Input Validation and Error Handling

Professional applications don't crash or produce confusing results when users enter bad data. Instead, they validate inputs before processing them and return helpful error messages when something goes wrong.

### The `isNaN()` Function

When you try to convert text to a number and it fails, JavaScript returns `NaN` (Not a Number). You can detect this with `isNaN()`:

```javascript
Number("hello")    // Returns: NaN
isNaN(Number("hello"))  // Returns: true (it IS NaN)
isNaN(Number("42"))     // Returns: false (it's a valid number)

// Practical example:
function add(a, b) {
  if (isNaN(a) || isNaN(b)) {
    return "Error: Invalid input";
  }
  return a + b;
}

add("hello", 5)  // Returns: "Error: Invalid input" âœ“
add(10, 5)       // Returns: 15 âœ“
```

### Checking for Special Cases

Some operations have specific restrictions:

**Division by zero:**
```javascript
function divide(a, b) {
  // First check if inputs are valid numbers
  if (isNaN(a) || isNaN(b)) {
    return "Error: Invalid input";
  }
  
  // Then check for impossible operation
  if (b === 0) {
    return "Error: Division by zero";
  }
  
  return a / b;
}
```

**Square root of negative numbers:**
```javascript
function squareRoot(a) {
  if (isNaN(a)) {
    return "Error: Invalid input";
  }
  
  if (a < 0) {
    return "Error: Cannot calculate square root of negative number";
  }
  
  return Math.sqrt(a);
}
```

### The Order Matters

Always validate in this order:
1. **First**: Check if inputs are valid numbers
2. **Second**: Check for operation-specific restrictions (divide by zero, negative square root, etc.)
3. **Third**: If all checks pass, perform the calculation

This ensures you catch basic problems before checking for special cases.

## Your Challenge

Real users make mistakes. They might:
- Type "hello" when they should enter a number
- Accidentally divide by zero
- Try to find the square root of a negative number

Your calculator should handle these gracefully:

**Before (confusing):**
```javascript
add("hello", 5)  // Returns NaN (what does that mean?)
divide(10, 0)    // Returns Infinity (not helpful!)
squareRoot(-16)  // Returns NaN (why?)
```

**After (clear):**
```javascript
add("hello", 5)  // Returns "Error: Invalid input"
divide(10, 0)    // Returns "Error: Division by zero"
squareRoot(-16)  // Returns "Error: Cannot calculate square root of negative number"
```

Open `012-calculator-validation.js`. Your task is to add validation to each function:

1. Check if inputs are valid numbers using `isNaN()`
2. Check for division by zero in `divide()` and `modulo()`
3. Check for negative numbers in `squareRoot()`
4. Return helpful error messages when problems are found

## Expected Output

When you run your code, you should see:
```
=== Valid Inputs ===
add(10, 5) = 15
subtract(10, 5) = 5
divide(10, 5) = 2

=== Invalid Inputs ===
add("hello", 5) = Error: Invalid input
multiply(10, "world") = Error: Invalid input
subtract("abc", "def") = Error: Invalid input

=== Division by Zero ===
divide(10, 0) = Error: Division by zero
modulo(10, 0) = Error: Division by zero

=== Negative Square Root ===
squareRoot(-16) = Error: Cannot calculate square root of negative number
squareRoot(16) = 4
```

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1: Understanding invalid data</summary>

When conversions fail, JavaScript produces a special value indicating "this isn't a valid number." Think about:
- What happens when you try to convert "hello" to a number?
- How can you detect when a conversion has failed?
- What special value represents calculation failure in JavaScript?

Detecting invalid data is the first step in defensive programming.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2: Checking for invalid inputs</summary>

Before performing calculations, you need to verify inputs are usable. Consider:
- How do you check if a converted value is actually a valid number?
- What should your function return when it receives invalid input?
- Does JavaScript provide a built-in way to test for invalid numeric values?

Validation creates a safety checkpoint before proceeding with operations.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3: Handling mathematical impossibilities</summary>

Some operations have special restrictions beyond just being numbers. Think about:
- What happens mathematically when you divide by zero?
- Can you calculate the square root of a negative number (in basic math)?
- How should your functions respond when asked to do impossible operations?

Different functions may need different validation checks based on their mathematical constraints.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 4: Ordering validation checks</summary>

When multiple things can go wrong, order matters. Consider:
- Should you check if something is a number before checking if it's zero?
- What's the most fundamental requirement that should be checked first?
- How do you structure multiple validation conditions?

Always validate the most basic requirements first before checking specific constraints.

```bash
cd exercises/012-calculator-validation
node 012-calculator-validation.js
```

To run the tests:
```bash
npm test
```

## What You're Learning

This exercise teaches essential error handling concepts:

- **Input validation**: Checking data before processing it
- **isNaN() function**: Detecting invalid numbers
- **Conditional logic**: Making decisions based on input
- **Error messages**: Providing helpful feedback to users
- **Defensive programming**: Planning for things to go wrong
- **Edge cases**: Handling special situations (divide by zero, negative square root)

## Reflection Questions

After completing the exercise, think about:
1. Why is it important to check for invalid input **before** division by zero?
2. What other errors might a calculator need to handle?
3. How would you improve these error messages to be even more helpful?

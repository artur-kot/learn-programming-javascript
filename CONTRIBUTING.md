Thank you for your interest into improving JavaScript Course.

Not gonna lie - it's a early phase of course where most of exercises are generated with AI.

And to be honest - there are parts where AI is **great** - like writing tests, boilerplate and starter code. It's really making things faster.

However, there are also **horrible** parts where improvements are needed - too long, not concise READMEs, possibility of hallucination and so on.

For today - we have `182` exercises which are covering many topics. [Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) is a good start to know the Table of Contents. Exercises with `<!-- TODO: to refine -->` comment is an exercise which requires a refined `README.md`, and overall looking.

I am pretty sure that amount of exercises should change, some of topics like *generators* can be squashed from 5 exercises to 2-3, where *Theme Switcher* with OOP fundamentals can be extended knowing that this topics covers many concepts.

## Goal
The best way to learn programming - **read and write a lot of code**.
The best way to learn **something** in IT - **implement it**.

# JavaScript Learning Roadmap

This roadmap guides you from zero programming knowledge to JavaScript proficiency through hands-on, practice-first exercises. Each series is an **incremental mini-project** where you build a small application step by step, adding more functionality with each exercise.

**How to use this roadmap:**
- Complete exercises in order - each builds on previous knowledge AND previous code
- Within a series, each exercise continues from the previous exercise's code
- Mark exercises complete with `[x]` as you finish them
- Don't skip ahead - the progression is carefully designed
- Take breaks between series to consolidate learning

**What makes this course unique:**
- Each series creates ONE complete mini-project
- You start simple and gradually add features
- You see real projects grow from basic to advanced
- You learn by building, not just reading
